Kevin Presbrey and the Midwest is a local favorite with a new batch of songs from his EP due out this summer.

Drawing upon the influences of sultry singer-songwriters such as Jim Croce and Ray Lamontagne, Kevin's songs are a marriage of the catchy hook and the rootsy americana track you might hear on a early 1970s record.
