Michael Gurley came to Los Angeles for school at UCLA to major in psychology and minor in music. Minor?

Those familiar with any of Michael's work know he is a major talent, not minor. Many who have followed his career since the early days of dada have long scratched their heads and wondered how circumstances have failed to render him the guitar god he is. "Underrated and overlooked" is just the tip of the iceberg. His work spans the incredible range of children's musicals, TV commercials, independent-artist production and songwriting mentorship, a jazz combo that could give any Sinatra fan satiation, founding membership in the greatest "one-hit (but only because radio treated them that way)" alternative-rock bands of the 90s, and, now, literally the right-hand-man position to Kiefer Sutherland.

Anyone who has a penchant for great music or at least appreciation for guitar technique is immediately converted upon hearing/seeing him play live. So where have all these opportunities to see him play lurked over the years?

Most of Michael's visibility over the years has been as one-third of <a href="http://dadaforever.com/">dada</a>. But like Joie and Phil, Michael has been involved in other bands (Louis and Clark, pre-dada; Mike Gurley and the Nightcaps; Butterfly Jones; The Dahls; Billy Boy On Poison; and <a href="http://kiefersutherlandmusic.com/">The Kiefer Sutherland Band</a> being the main ones). He started doing house concerts about eight years ago, and Chicago is the city that gladly brings him back every year (with the exception of 2015, because yours truly was in the process of moving across the country and couldn't quite squeeze it into her schedule at the time). In these intimate shows, Michael plays music his fans know well--dada staples--and things they can't get anywhere else: the very first song he ever wrote ("Martian Named Mack"), songs he's written for other artists ("River Called Love"), songs that are so new that no one has heard them ("Two Different Girls," which isn't exactly new anymore).

Michael's musicianship is of the highest caliber. There is no question he is one of the great unheralded guitarists of his time--if not all time--in several genres. (Little-known fact: MG started as a rhythm guitarist and had a moment of clarity only after a time on rhythm, that he should start playing lead!) Rock. Jazz. Blues. Country. Folk. But not as many people realize how razor-sharp his vocal technique is. His pitch is always ON; he nails it every time. This is another true gift: consistency in excellence.

The vibe at a Michael show is like a family reunion of people who really love each other. Many of us have been hardcore dada fans (and by logical extension, Michael-solo fans, as well) for a long time, and we treasure each other's company as well as the music that brought us all together in the first place.  It really is special. Come on down to the show this weekend and experience it. I'll literally welcome you with a hug at the door on <a href="https://www.gigable.net/campaigns/pending-michael-gurley-haymarket-brewery-chicago/">Saturday</a> if you want one.  See you there!
