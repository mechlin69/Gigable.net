We're very excited to tell you about two artists that we have been featuring in our playlists. Both Sturgill Simpson and Ari Hest have Grammy nominations for their latest works.

Sturgill's album, "Sailor's Guide To Earth" has been nominated for Album of the Year!

Ari Hest and Judy Collins' album, "Silver Skies Blue" for Best Folk Album!

Congrats to both. Have a listen to their tracks and our conversation.
