I want to take a moment today and thank everyone who has been involved in building Gigable over the past 3 years. It has been an amazing journey thus far and we are grateful to all the music fans who have come to our shows and downloaded our app. We have several exciting announcements coming over the next month, so please stay tuned.

We are in the midst of a revolution. Quite possibly in more ways than we may realize, but a musical revolution to say the least. Thousands upon thousands of creators are collaborating and making beautiful art. They are creating at a pace that is unprecedented. Our hope with Gigable is that we can connect more fans to these creators and bring more music to more people all around the world.

I would personally like to thank those who are closest to our endeavor; Bobby &amp; Penny Bankston, John &amp; Vicky Mayer, Chirag Patel, Nick Kraly, Umang Bhatt, Jen Gies, Dana Balicki, Alex Dezen, Kevin Presbrey, Michael Gurley, Matt Adell, Greg Rudin and of course my wife Dianne. This is a crazy business and one of our aspirations is to make it a little less wacky and more sustainable for artists abroad.

Thanks for listening and Happy Thanksgiving!

Next week's episode we will have an in-depth interview with Kevin Presbrey and a special announcement.
