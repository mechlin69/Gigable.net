This could be the start of something big! Â We've officially launched our first Gigable campaign.

Michael Gurley and the Nightcaps is scheduled to appear at Wire in Berwyn, IL. pending a successful campaign! The people at Wire are awesome and worked with us to accommodate this new booking model. We are excited to work with Michael on this project and look forward to seeing the Nightcaps bring some incredible jazz to Chicago.

The Gigable platform itself is in pretty good shape, but we're keeping a close eye on everything to clean up any minor issues that may pop up.
