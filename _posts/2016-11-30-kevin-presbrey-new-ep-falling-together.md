For singer-songwriter Kevin Presbrey, he strives to keep a positive outlook on such matters. The feeling for his new songs are about togetherness - or "falling together." Where his first solo EP, "Dust Unto Dust" was centered around picking up the pieces following the sudden passing of his father, this album is a reflection of his frame of mind as life moved forward with his father there in spirit.<span class="m_-7781378854964173540Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<p class="m_-7781378854964173540p1"><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s1">Falling Together is about relationships, bonding, and simply enjoying life. From great tragedy comes great triumph - and peace.</span></p>
<p class="m_-7781378854964173540p1"><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s1">The opening track and first single, "Seaside" is a magical tune that instantly transports you to a walk on the beach underneath the moonlight. If Hawaii needs a new theme song, this is it. The more upbeat tunes, such as "Restless Heart" and "It Could Be Worse" harken back a bit to Kevin's alternative days with Painkiller Hotel. These songs have that timeless rock vibe, and if </span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s2">Van Morrison</span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s1"> collaborated with Jacob Dylan, these songs might be the result. "Miss Sunny Day" is a uke-driven pop song that will make you tap your feet and smile every time you hear it.</span></p>
<p class="m_-7781378854964173540p1"><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s1">After working Ryan Hadlock (</span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s2">The Lumineers</span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s1">, </span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s2">The Strumbellas</span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s1"> and </span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s2">Vance Joy</span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s1">) on the very successful Dust Unto Dust album, Kevin knew the importance of finding the right producer for this project. Recorded in Nashville with producer Skylar Wilson (Andrew Combs, </span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s2">Rayland Baxter</span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s1"> ,and </span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s2">Justin Townes Earle</span><span class="m_-7781378854964173540s1">), Kevin tapped into that white hot East Nashville vibe. Amazingly recorded in just 7 days over two sessions, these songs came together quickly. Kevin had a batch of songs, probably 10 to 12 in total and landed on 6 gems for "Falling Together."</span></p>
