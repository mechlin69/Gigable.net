We had an amazing night hosting our first show in the Americana series. All three bands knocked it out of the park and the crowd showed lots of love.

The production staff at Woodstock Opera House are top notch and we look forward to working with them on many more shows.

Hereâ€™s some behind the scenes footage of sound check and the view from backstage:
