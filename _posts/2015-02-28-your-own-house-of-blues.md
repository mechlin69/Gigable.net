Had the opportunity to go see one of my favorite bands last night...Big Head Todd &amp; the Monsters at House of Blues in Chicago.  I had been keeping my eye out for them to see when they were in town again and if they had any new material out.  When I saw they were at HOB, I snagged a ticket in December and could not wait for the show.  I guess I was not the only one...the show was sold out. It was a great feeling being surrounded by a group of fans as excited to see BHT as me in one of the best venues to see live music in Chicago.  I had not been to HOB in awhile and I was impressed that for a pretty decent sized venue, it felt pretty intimate which has really become a "must" when I see a band.  I paid about $50 for the ticket and really had a great experience.  They sounded great as always and the room had great energy.

As I prepare for my house concert with Kelly Steward next month, I am looking forward to bringing the same House of Blues feel right into the family room.  Again surrounded by friends and fans in an intimate setting getting to listen and experience one of my favorite artists.  With this experience though, my friends and I get to interact with Kelly and Greg and engage in another level of music enjoyment.  Getting to know the artists on a personal level.

If you are a music-lover like me, getting to connect with your favorite artist(s) is amazing.  I am glad to connect with Gigable as it is making this experience more accessible to fans like me.  Looking forward to many more shows to come.
