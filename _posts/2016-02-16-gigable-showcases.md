We are very excited to announce our <a href="http://www.woodstockoperahouse.com/files/Events/PerformancePages/2016Emerging_Artist_Showcase.html" target="_blank">Emerging Artist Showcase</a> series is coming to Woodstock, IL! We have partnered with the Woodstock Opera House to bring the best indie music to northern Illinois. The show starts at <strong>7pm on April 2, 2016</strong>. <a href="https://www.gigable.net/campaigns/emerging-artist-showcase-woodstock-opera-house/" target="_blank">VIP passes</a> and <a href="http://www.woodstockoperahouse.com/files/Events/PerformancePages/2016Emerging_Artist_Showcase.html" target="_blank">reserved seats</a> are available.

The Woodstock Opera House was built in 1889 and was fully restored in 1971. Many popular artists such as John Oates, Leon Russell and Louden Wainwright III have played there in recent years.

Our lineup consists of three artists:

<a href="http://www.kevinpresbrey.com" target="_blank">Kevin Presbrey</a> is a singer/songwriter from Aurora.  Kevin has been touring the midwest for the last two years supporting his profoundly moving debut EP, "Dust Unto Dust."

<a href="http://www.bridgetdavismusic.com" target="_blank">Bridget Davis and the Viking Kings</a> is a band from Brooklyn formed in 2010.  They have three albums and have been touring the east coast for many years. Their latest album, "I Wasn't Planning On The End" was released in September of 2015 and has gained much attention worldwide.

The third act coming to the showcase is an amazing singer/songwriter from Nashville, <a href="http://www.devindawsonmusic.com/" target="_blank">Devin Dawson</a>. Devin's videos on YouTube have over 30m views and his debut EP is due out shortly.

We are truly excited about all these artists and looking forward to hearing them in the perfectly tuned Woodstock Opera House.  If you appreciate listening to live music in a near-perfect setting, this is the show to see (and hear).
