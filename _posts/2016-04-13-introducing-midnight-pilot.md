We're excited to introduce you to a band that we've been listening to for the last few months.

Midnight Pilot is a 4-piece band from Nashville, TN. who have been playing together since childhood. A very rare feat to be sure.

Their folk-rock americana music has a mature approach and moving melodies.

Keep an eye (and ear) out for a future podcast episode with a full interview.

Here's a track from their debut album, but don't let the mellow tunes lead you astray. Â These guys rock.
