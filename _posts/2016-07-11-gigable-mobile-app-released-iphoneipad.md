We're very excited to announce that our mobile app is now available in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gigable-music-discovery/id1118761510?mt=8">Apple App Store</a>!

There’s more music being created now than any other time in history and who has the time to search through Spotify? The Gigable Music app will bring the cream of the crop to the surface. Pick a playlist, press play. If the song hits you, there’s a ticket button to go see the band live. The “local playlist” uses GPS to automagically build a playlist based on bands touring near you. Simple and potent. No fluff and no ads! It’s like radio 2.0.

The app itself has been months in the making. The concept is something we've been experimenting with for years.

There’s several very cool shows we are producing this summer to introduce some of the music we are finding. You can see the <a href="https://www.gigable.net/">schedule</a> here or in the app!

Thanks for listening!
