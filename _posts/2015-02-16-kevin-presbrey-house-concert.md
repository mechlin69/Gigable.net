As the co-founder of this little website called Gigable it makes a lot of sense to host house concerts! My partner in crime, Dana is a maven when it comes to finding talent in the Chicago music scene.  Kevin Presbrey was an artist that grabbed his attention right away. Last year, Dana invited Kevin to play <a title="Rock The Heart" href="http://www.rushcopley.com/giving/fox-valley-heart-fund/rock-the-heart/" target="_blank">Rock The Heart</a>, a fundraiser for Rush Copley Heart Foundation. Kevin and I shared the stage at the fundraiser to play a few of our originals. The conversation afterwards immediately led us to organizing a house concert.

So, the date was set and we launched a campaign to bring Mr. Presbrey to West Dundee. After a few quick emails to friends who are music lovers here in town, we sold 30 tickets in a matter of days.  We hired Jen Gies to cater the event and prepared for a night of music. A local bakery, <a title="Deliciously Evil Treats" href="https://www.facebook.com/deliciouslyeviltreats" target="_blank">Deliciously Evil Treats</a> provided some amazing cupcakes!

The results were fantastic and Kevin won over a room full of new fans! The feedback we received from everyone was amazing.  Kevin will surely be back in the Dundee area several times per year.
