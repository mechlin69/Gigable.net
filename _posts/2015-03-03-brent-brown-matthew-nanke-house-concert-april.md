This show will be in the West Dundee, IL. area (host TBD) and will feature the original music of <a title="Brent Brown" href="http://gigable.net/author/bbrown" target="_blank">Brent Brown</a> and <a title="Matthew Nanke" href="http://gigable.net/author/mnanke" target="_blank">Matthew Nanke</a>.

Brent released his latest album last year and has a growing fanbase worldwide due to the hit single "I Got Soul."
