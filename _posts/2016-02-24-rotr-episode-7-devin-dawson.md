From highly technical death metal to country, Devin Dawson has a wide spectrum of musical chops. At the pinnacle, is his songwriting.

In this episode, Devin talks about what it feels like to have a video go super-viral to the point where his phone locks up. He also talks about working hard as a singer/songwriter and writing on a daily basis. He certainly has a lot of momentum going into the studio this spring with Jay Joyce to work on his first official album.

Devin is as "emerging" as they come.  We're very excited for his performance at our <a href="https://www.gigable.net/campaigns/emerging-artist-showcase-woodstock-opera-house/">showcase</a> on April 2, 2016.
