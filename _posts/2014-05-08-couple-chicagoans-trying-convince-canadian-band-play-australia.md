Our second major campaign is underway, and it's big. I (Jen here) found a Facebook group last year called "We Want Rush to Tour Australia." Folks after my own heart. Rush? Australia? Bring it on.

What we're doing is meant to convince Australian promoters that it would indeed be worth their effort to, as the "About" section of this page declares, "Dear Aussie concert promoters, we are the Rush fans - GET OFF YER REAR ENDS AND GET OUR FAVOURITE BAND TO COME PLAY FOR US!"

What Gigable is asking Rush fans to do is put their money where their mouths are, and pledge and rally others to do the same. Showing real commitment to the cause.

There are two very important points to keep at the forefront on this matter: 1. Waiting for others to pledge accomplishes nothing; however, pledging is a zero-risk enterprise. What a pledge is is simply "pre-approval" for a payment via PayPal. No one outside your bank is going to see a penny of your money unless and until we get a green light from SRO (Rush's management). 2. Pledging alone is only the minimum of what Gigable is about. What will serve this (and any similar) campaign is grassroots, word-of-mouth, busting-out-with-enthusiasm street teaming. You want it? Get proactive.

Got a birthday? Ask people to make a pledge instead of buying you a gift. Ask your internet friends and internet forums to get excited and show their solidarity. Surely fans of music this great excelÂ at showing the love.

Some people on that Facebook page have claimed they would sell a kidney to see Rush in Australia. That dedication is being called on now to make this campaign a success. If a regular tickets sell and a couple thousand people chip in other amounts (pledges as easy as $10 each!), maybe we can get the band's attention and make a once-in-a-lifetime dream a reality for our Australian brothers and sisters.

Rest assured that Mike and I, as serious Rush fans ourselves, are working some other angles, which we hope you'll start seeing results of soon.

Neil will just have to ship his bike Down Under for this one.

Make a pledge and then street team it up!
