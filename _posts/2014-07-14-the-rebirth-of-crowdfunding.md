In 1981, thirty-three years ago, twelve years before my friend Mike, who is the most computer- and internet-oriented person I have ever known (and definitely the earliest adherent I know) got online, and twenty-three years before Facebook was created, a community of music fans rallied around a cause and succeeded in getting something that they wanted but thought extremely unlikely.

The Rolling Stones added a Rockford, Illinois date to their <em>Tattoo You</em> tour, because roughly 35,000 people signed petitions circulated by a local radio station. Because the idea “sort of struck their fancy,” The Stones said something like, “Oh, hell, why not?” And Rockford got its show.

A radio station (WZOK). A word-of-mouth community in relative geographic isolation. Actual signatures on pieces of paper. Remember paper and clipboards? I had the opportunity to talk to Jeff Rowe, who was Program Director at WZOK at the time.

Here’s how the timeline played for the “Bring the Stones to Rockford” petition drive:

In mid- to late spring of 1981, several things were going on in Rockfordites’ world: unemployment was high, the new Metro Center arena had just opened its doors, and The Rolling Stones announced U. S. Tattoo You tour dates for later in the year. Jeff Rowe got the idea for the petition drive, but didn’t want to “go rogue” with putting it into action, so he contacted Doug Logan, then-manager of Metro Center, and Bill Graham Presents, the legendary concert-promotion agency out of the Bay Area, which was promoting the <em>Tattoo You</em> tour in the U.S. Mr. Rowe asked BGP whether they (BGP) would get the WZOK audience’s pending petition papers to the Stones. BGP agreed.

Thinking it was a long shot at best, WZOK made announcements for a few days, then started circulating actual petitions. Over a three-week period, those 35,000 signatures were collected on what filled five boxes worth of paper. Rowe hand-delivered the five boxes of petitions to Bill Graham people at a Santana show at Poplar Creek (Hoffman Estates, IL, June 7, 1981).Then he was compelled to keep doings on the matter under wraps from the public.

In late August, BGP called Doug Logan and requested that he and Jeff Rowe come to New York to meet and discuss the tentative Rockford show. The men from Illinois were told that the Stones were setting up several “unannounced” shows at smaller venues, but that if anything were said prematurely, BGP would deny it.

Around Labor Day, there was a press conference with the announcement that there would be upcoming “surprise” shows by the Stones as they were headed west across the U.S.

In the second week of September, the Rockford show was announced; those whose signatures on the petitions were legible were entered into a drawing for the chance to buy pairs of tickets.

Subsequently and after a whole lot of press—including a story on <em>Good Morning, America</em>—8800 fans got to see The Rolling Stones in Rockford, Illinois on October 1. Unprecedented and extremely collectible tickets were printed, on which the promotion credit read: “Presented by Music Fans of Rockford, IL.”

Now here we are, ensconced in the twenty-first century, and oh, how things have changed. Someone in Columbus, Ohio has received $42,000 in pledges on a six-day-old (and 23 to go) Kickstarter campaign with an original goal of $10—so he can make potato salad.

The Foo Fighters are playing a crowd-funded show in Richmond, Virgina, after a successful campaign that was run by freelance creative director and copywriter Andrew Goldin.

There's certainly more to come and we are excited to be a part of it!
