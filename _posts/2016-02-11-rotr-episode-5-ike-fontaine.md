How do you get booked on a 4-month tour on an Australian cruise ship?  Ike Fontaine knows and he will tell you in this episode.

Fontaine is a duo group based in Raleigh, NC.  Their exquisite songwriting has carried them all across the U.S. and most recently being featured at the Periscope summit in San Fancisco.

Ike and I discuss the new music business and what it takes to make a career. Ike has a lot of insights and is a great example of how songwriters/musicians can make their own career in 2016.
