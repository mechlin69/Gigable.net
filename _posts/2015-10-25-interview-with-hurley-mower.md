I was first introduced to Hurley's music by Jonas Daniels in Germany.  Jonas and I happened to be on Blab discussing crowdfunded concerts and he found out Gigable is based in Chicago - same as Hurley.

I was very intrigued with Hurley's style and approach to remixes, so I reached out to him for an interview.  He's an amazing talent with a very bright future and we're lucky to meet him.

You can listen to the 38 minute interview with this link:
