Hi, everyone!

It was a year ago that Mike and I were feverishly working behind the scenes to prepare the Nightcaps campaign budget and get Gigable launched. I can't believe it's been a whole year since I was packing for my trip to Mexico and juggling Gigable stuff at the same time. This year, I'm packing for Nashville and simmering three ideas for exciting Chicago-area campaigns to prepare, budget, and launch after the turn of the year. I expect to be on the phone to Los Angeles a bit in the coming weeks.

2014 also saw some international press for Gigable and some pretty solid validation of our vision by way of the always-awesome Dave Grohl. Richmond, VA saw its Foo Fighters dream come true because of a crowd-sourcing campaign exactly like Gigable's campaigns. A few other Foo Fighters campaigns followed and surpassed funding goals. Crowd-sourcing in general became a household term because some guy in Columbus wanted to make potato salad. And, perhaps coolest of all, Gigable went international: we now have a Japanese partner.

Stay tuned for 2015. We'll have at least one house concert campaign being promoted; another Nightcaps campaign (but it will be several weeks later on the calendar, so folks won't be afraid to make a commitment to a Chicago trip from other parts of the country); one possible rock 'n roll show campaign for a band that's been around a long time but that I've only recently discovered (the only hint I can give you is that they have been in town recently but opened for someone else. This would be their show); and, a campaign for a comedian. (These are all going to be Chicago-area gigs.)

If you have friends online or next door who are interested in launching a campaign for a show anywhere in the world and they are willing to promote the campaign to make their dream show a reality in their town, have them give us a shout. We can do it now that we have PayPal as a payment partner. Mike and I both get email notifications via the support@gigable.net address.

Be safe, have fun, and rock on as we wind down 2014.

Jen
