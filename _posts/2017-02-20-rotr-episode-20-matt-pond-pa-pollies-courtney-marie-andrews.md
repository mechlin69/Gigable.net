In this episode, John and Mike feature a couple of amazing veteran singer/songwriters.

In honor of Black History Month, we chose the song "Jackson" from The Pollies. This song is a tribute to Jimmy Lee Jackson who was shot and led to the march on Selma.

Featured songs:

<strong>Courtney Marie Andrews - "Irene"</strong>

<strong>Matt Pond PA - "Louisville"</strong>

<strong>The Pollies - "Jackson"</strong>
