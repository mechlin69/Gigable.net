Bridget Davis and the Viking Kings. The name pretty much says it all.  A killer name for an awesome band.

In this episode of Raised On The Radio, Bridget talks about how the band formed and a particular member who influenced the name.

Bridget is a classically trained pianist and seasoned songwriter which allows her to be a superhero musician. In our discussion, she talks about how the name of her latest album came about.

Have a listen to the stories behind "I Wasn't Planning On The End."
