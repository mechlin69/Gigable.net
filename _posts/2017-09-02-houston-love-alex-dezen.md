Â His bandmate/mentor/friend, Matt Hammond has lived there forever and Alex attributes much songwriting influence to Matt. Matt is also married to Alex's sister Cameron. Cameron sent Alex a note saying, "you need to write a song for Houston. Houston has given you a lot over the past 20+ years."

So he did. Within 24 hours of the note.
