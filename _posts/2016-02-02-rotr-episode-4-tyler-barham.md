From a small town in Montana to millions of YouTube views - to a VIP influencer for T-Mobile. Tyler Barham has made quite a name for himself with his killer cover versions of many country artists and his own original music.

Tyler along with his writing partner John Griffin made their way to the Chicago area for a pair of house concerts courtesy of Gigable.

We got a chance to talk to Tyler just minutes after he arrived to discuss his music and fast growing career.

He also performed a solo version of "17 &amp; Young" in studio that was captured in this podcast.  Enjoy.
