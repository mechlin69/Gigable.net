L.A. needs rain - according to Alex Dezen.  He'll tell you why in this episode.

Alex is a singer/songwriter with a 20-year history writing some of the most honest songs you will find anywhere. His first official solo album is due out on 2/12/16 and it's probably the most honest yet.

Alex also fronts the band The Damnwells and although they are still together, Alex had a batch of songs that were fit to stand on their own. He recorded and produced the entire album in his apartment in L.A.

Listen to the first two tracks on his YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_U8mTW9Ymea29T8TZBjbZg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_U8mTW9Ymea29T8TZBjbZg</a>
