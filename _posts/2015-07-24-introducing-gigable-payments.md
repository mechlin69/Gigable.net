Gigable Paymentsâ„¢ is the easiest way for artists/bands to get paid for a gig. This is how it works:
<ol>
	<li>Once a gig is booked and confirmed, a Gigable Payment Request is created with the date/time of gig and payment amount.</li>
	<li>The GPR is emailed to venue/promoter with a link to setup payment.</li>
	<li>The payer submits their payment promise via credit card (this is a pre-approval and no money is exchanged).</li>
	<li>Money is collected and distributed automatically based on the timestamp of GPR. No intervention is required by any party.</li>
</ol>
This service removes the need for the band to seek out payment after the gig (or wait for a check) and allows the venue to manage payments easier. Full or partial refunds are possible for 60 days after the gig in the event of unforeseen expenses.

Payments are distributed into band PayPal account where funds can be immediately sent to all musicians.

Gigable Payments are available in 6 currencies and 223 countries!
