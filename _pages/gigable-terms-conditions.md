Welcome to the Gigable Terms and Conditions (or “Agreement”). This Agreement describes the terms and conditions that govern your use of our services at <a href="http://www.gigable.net/">http://www.gigable.net/</a> (our "Site" or “Platform”). Before you may become a member of our Site you must read, agree with and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and Gigable's policies, including its Privacy Policy (the "Policies"). These Policies change from time to time, and you agree that they form part of this Agreement. Our Privacy Policies may be accessed here: Privacy Policy. Each time you use our services you confirm your agreement to be bound by and acknowledge any changes to the Agreement (including the Policies). You also undertake to familiarize yourself with and comply with the Policies relevant to your use of our Site and the services provided under this Agreement (as may be amended from time to time). As you read this Agreement, you should also access and read the information contained in the other pages and websites referred to in this Agreement.

&nbsp;

By accepting this Agreement (including the Policies) you agree to be bound by it and also the User Agreements and posted terms and conditions on other websites operated by Gigable and its related and affiliated companies, to the extent that you use those websites.

&nbsp;

We may amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement from time to time. Amended terms will be posted on our Site. Except as stated in this Agreement, in a Policy, or as otherwise notified to you, all amended terms will automatically be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Terms and Conditions constitutes acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree with such changes to this Agreement (or any of our Policies), you must terminate your membership with Gigable. If, after any such changes to this Agreement or any of our Policies you continue to be a member of our Site, you will be considered by us to have accepted the varied terms as part of the Agreement.

&nbsp;

Except as specifically described in or authorized by this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement and any of our Policies cannot be amended except in writing signed by you and Gigable.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h1>Gigable is a Venue and a Service Provider</h1>
Gigable is an online crowdfunding service and acts as a venue to allow members who comply with Gigable's policies to offer, sell and buy certain goods or experiences within a fixed-price format. Gigable allows invited individuals, groups and organisations ("Campaign Creators") to list Campaigns and raise funds through selling items, experiences and offering services ("Rewards") to new and existing Gigable members ("Campaign Supporters").

&nbsp;

Gigable is not directly involved in the transaction between Campaign Creators and Campaign Supporters. As a result, Gigable has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the Rewards listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of Campaign Creator to sell Rewards or the ability of Campaign Supporter to pay for Rewards. Gigable cannot ensure that a Campaign Supporter or a Campaign Creator will actually complete a transaction. Consequently, Gigable does not transfer legal ownership of Rewards from the Campaign Supporter to the Campaign Creator.

&nbsp;

Gigable cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a member.

&nbsp;

You agree that Gigable is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other members, or outside parties on Gigable. You use the Gigable service at your own risk.

&nbsp;
<h1>Campaigns</h1>
All funds are collected for Campaign Creators through the PayPal online payment service and/or the Gigable Credit/Debit Card Merchant facility. Gigable collects and transfers these funds to the Campaign Creator only if the Campaign is successfully funded before the Campaign Deadline.

&nbsp;

Gigable shall not be liable for the interactions with any organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Gigable service. This includes, but is not limited to, delivery of goods and services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with listings on Gigable.

&nbsp;

Gigable cannot be held liable for the actions of a Campaign Creator, Campaign Creators are nevertheless wholly responsible for fulfilling obligations both implied and stated in any Campaign listing they create. Gigable does not oversee the performance or punctuality of Campaigns. Gigable reserves the right to cancel a Campaign listing and refund all associated members' payments at any time for any reason. Gigable reserves the right to remove a Campaign listing from public listings for any reason.

&nbsp;

Gigable is not responsible for any damage or loss incurred as a result of any dealings on the Gigable platform. All dealings are solely between you and such individuals and/or organisations. Gigable is under no obligation to become involved in disputes between Campaign Supporters and Campaign Creators, or between site members and any third party. In the event of a dispute, you release Gigable employees, partners and successors in rights from claims, damages and demands of every kind, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and our service.

&nbsp;

Gigable cannot guarantee the performance or reliability of the PayPal online payment service. Additionally, because of occasional failures of some credit cards, Gigable cannot guarantee the full receipt of the total funds pledged to a Campaign Creator's Campaign.

&nbsp;

Campaign creators and Campaign supporters must also agree and comply with the <a href="https://cms.paypal.com/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=ua/AcceptableUse_full">PayPal Acceptable Use Policy</a>

&nbsp;

Gigable cannot guarantee the full receipt of pledged funds due to occasional failures when capturing funds from debit and credit cards.

&nbsp;
<h1>Campaign Rewards and After Sales</h1>
By listing a Campaign Reward on the Site you warrant that you and all aspects of the Reward comply with Gigable's published policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the Reward(s). You must accurately describe your Rewards and all terms of sale in your Campaign Description and the Reward description. Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures, videos, photographs and other content relevant to the sale of that Reward. Each Reward must accurately and completely describe the item(s) or experiences on offer. If the "Available" quantity is more than one or unlimited, all items and/or experiences listed in that Reward tier must be identical. Each unique Reward must have its own listing as a new Reward.

&nbsp;

All Campaign Creators are urged to outline seller policies for their Gigable Campaign. These policies may include, for example, shipping, returns, payment and selling policies. Campaign Creators must create reasonable policies in good faith and must abide by such policies. All seller policies must comply with Gigable's site-wide policies. Campaign Creators are responsible for enforcing their own reasonable seller policies. Gigable reserves the right to request that a Campaign Creator modify a seller policy.

&nbsp;

All sales are binding. The seller is obligated to ship the Reward(s) or otherwise complete the transaction with the Campaign Supporter, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the Campaign Supporter fails to meet the terms of the Campaign Creator's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the Campaign Creator cannot authenticate the Campaign Supporter's identity. The Campaign Supporter is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for Rewards purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.

&nbsp;
<h1>Gigable Collections / Gigable Campaign Sponsorship</h1>

&nbsp;
<h1>Fees</h1>
Registering as a Gigable member and setting up a Campaign on Gigable is free. Gigable charges fees to Campaign Creators only if their Campaign successfully reaches their funding target.

&nbsp;

<b>Successful Campaigns</b>

&nbsp;

In the case of successful Campaigns, Gigable will initiate a capture of all funds from Campaign Supporters and transfer the funds to the Campaign Creator directly (minus the Gigable fees).

&nbsp;

<b>Gigable Service Fee:</b>

&nbsp;

5%: total funds raised up to $100k

4%: total funds raised between $100k - $500k (or Campaigns issued an invitation code)

3%: total funds raised of $500k or over

&nbsp;

<b>Transaction Fees:</b>

&nbsp;

Credit / Debit Card on Gigable : 2.4% + 30c (U.S. card) / 3.4% + 30c (international card) for each transaction.

<b>PayPal Fees:</b>

&nbsp;

Fees vary depending on your PayPal account type and location. For example, for commercial transactions in United States, the fee is 2.4% + 30c per transaction. For a full list of PayPal fees, visit this <a href="https://cms.paypal.com/au/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=ua/FeesPolicy_full&amp;locale.x=en_AU">PayPal</a> page.

&nbsp;

The funds are transferred directly to the Campaign Creator's PayPal account.

&nbsp;

There is a 7 day processing period (after the end of a successful Campaign) in which supporters who have had their pledges declined are invited to resubmit their pledge. Thereafter there is a 3­5 day period for bank transfers to be processed to the Campaign creator’s account. Please factor in this duration when deciding how long your Campaign should run for.

&nbsp;

<b>Unsuccessful Campaigns</b>

&nbsp;

In the case of unsuccessful Campaigns, the pre­authorized transaction for a Campaign Supporter's pledge will be cancelled by Gigable at the Campaign deadline. No funds will be captured from the Campaign Supporters and no funds will be transferred to the Campaign Creator. No fees or charges apply.

&nbsp;
<h1>Delivery and Refunds</h1>
Funds collected for Successfully funded Campaigns through the Gigable platform are nonrefundable and Gigable is not responsible for issuing refunds to Campaign Supporters. Gigable transfers the funds to the Campaign Creator for successful Campaigns after the Campaign deadline. Campaign Creators may initiate refunds at their own discretion. If, for any reason, Gigable is required to refund monies to Campaign Supporters, the Campaign Creator will fully compensate Gigable for the amount refunded as well as any associated costs, including but not limited to transaction or administrative costs. Please contact admin@Gigable.com if you need further advice on this.

&nbsp;

The Campaign Creator is wholly responsible for meeting any obligation or Reward stated or implied in their Campaign. Gigable is not responsible for the delivery of Rewards stated in Campaigns. Campaign Supporters should contact the Campaign Creator if the delivery terms are not clearly stated in the Campaign description.

&nbsp;

Like all Policies, we may change our fees policy and the fees for our services. We may choose to temporarily change our fees policy and the fees for our services for promotional events (for example, free service days) and such changes are effective when we post the temporary promotional event. If we introduce a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in the currency of the Campaign. You are responsible for paying all fees associated with using our services and our Site and all applicable taxes (including any goods and services or value added taxes, which will be added to amounts billed to you, if applicable). The Gigable fees must never be mentioned on Campaign listings but you may wish to consider Gigable fees when determining the funding goal of your Campaign.

&nbsp;

You understand and agree that any attempt to make any charge back or otherwise reclaim or obtain a refund of or a credit against any fees paid for the service without first having obtained prior written consent to refund shall entitle Gigable to deactivate your account unless and/or until such time as the fees are repaid or a credit or refund is agreed with Gigable. Deactivation will include all access to the service including previously purchased additional features and/or the free aspects of Gigable.

&nbsp;

Furthermore, you may not list a Campaign on our Site (or complete any transaction that was initiated using our service), if the payment to us of the service fee, would be likely to cause us to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation, or if the item violates our current Prohibited, Questionable and Infringing Items list current at the relevant time.

&nbsp;
<h1>Electronic Communications</h1>
The communications between you and Gigable use electronic means, whether you visit the Site or send us emails, or whether Gigable posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Gigable in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Gigable provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were in writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.

&nbsp;
<h1>Support</h1>
Gigable does provide limited support for the Software or Service. However, Gigable may provide access to a protected forum for the User to send any questions and/or comments regarding the Software or Service. Gigable does not, however, make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy of any statements or advice provided in response to support postings.
<h1>Usage</h1>
Improper Usage of Gigable. We reserve the right to reduce, liquidate, deactivate, suspend or terminate your Gigable membership or access thereto if we terminate the Service or if we suspect, after investigation, that you have misused the Gigable service, violated the terms of this Agreement, or have otherwise used the Gigable service to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.

&nbsp;

In the event an account is suspended or terminated for your breach of this Agreement (in each case as determined in Gigable's sole discretion), Gigable may suspend or terminate the account associated with such breach and any or all other accounts held by you or your affiliates, and your breach shall be deemed to apply to all such accounts.

&nbsp;
<h1>General Terms</h1>
You and we are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement creates a partnership, employment relationship or agency. There are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. You may not assign this Agreement or your rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party without our prior written consent, and any attempt by you to do so will be invalid. Should any part of this Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of the right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement. Gigable will not be liable for any delay or failure to provide its services caused by a factor outside Gigable’s reasonable control (including but not limited to any act of God, war, breakdown of plant, industrial dispute, electricity failure, governmental or legal restraint).

&nbsp;
<h1>Your Information</h1>
Definition. "Your Information" means any item you list as well as any information you give to us or other members in the registration or listing process, in any public message area (including the discussion boards and in feedback) or through any email feature. Your Information also includes the Campaign information you list for sale or display on our Site, as well as any content you post on other web pages within our Site (including photographs or other images).

&nbsp;

You are solely responsible for Your Information. We act as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of Your Information.

&nbsp;

Your Information must not, in any way whatsoever, be potentially or actually harmful to Gigable or any third party, where "harm" includes, but is not limited to non-economic loss that will or may be suffered by Gigable.

&nbsp;

a. be false, inaccurate or misleading or deceptive;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

c. infringe any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or intellectual property rights, rights of publicity, confidentiality or privacy;

&nbsp;

e. be defamatory, libellous, threatening or harassing;

&nbsp;

f. be obscene or contain any material that, in Gigable's sole and absolute discretion, is in any way inappropriate or unlawful, including, but not limited to obscene, inappropriate or unlawful images and, if otherwise adult in nature, shall be distributed only to people legally permitted to receive such

&nbsp;

h. contain any malicious code, data or set of instructions that intentionally or unintentionally causes harm or subverts the intended function of any Gigable website, including, but not limited to viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, easter eggs or other computer programming routines that may damage, modify, delete, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, access without authority or expropriate any system, data or personal information;

&nbsp;

i. create liability for us or cause us to lose (in whole or in part) the services of our ISPs or other suppliers; or

&nbsp;

j. link directly or indirectly to or include descriptions of goods or services that are prohibited under this Agreement;

&nbsp;

Solely to enable Gigable to use the information you supply us with, so that we are not violating any rights you might have in that information, you agree to grant us a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers) right to do and authorise the doing of all acts comprised in the copyright and to exercise the publicity, and database rights (but no other rights) you have in Your Information, in any media now known or not currently known, with respect to Your Information. Gigable will only use Your Information in accordance with our Privacy Policy (located here). We need this to use and display your content.
<h1>Tax &amp; Legal Compliance</h1>

Notwithstanding successful conclusion of a transaction you must ensure strict compliance with any particular formalities which, if not complied with, will either render a transaction void or unlawful (eg. the sale of interests in real property ordinarily requires a written document to be created).

&nbsp;

Campaign Creators must ensure that they comply with all applicable laws in United States and all other countries. Campaign Creators must also ensure that they strictly comply with this agreement and the policies which form part of the agreement.
