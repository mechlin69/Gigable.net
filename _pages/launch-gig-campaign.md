<h2><b>What are crowdfunded concerts?</b></h2>
Crowdfunding is the practice where many individuals "pledge" toward a funding goal for a project. With Gigable's crowdfunded concerts, fans are pledging for a ticket (or other rewards/incentives) to a gig that will only happen if the goal is met.
<blockquote>For example, Julie's favorite artist is known to play house concerts, but he lives 2000 miles from her. Julie connects to the artist through Gigable and finds out he will play a house concert in her town for $1000 plus expenses. She then launches a campaign to sell 40 tickets at $45. She posts on social media and informs other fans of the potential show. Fans pledge for a ticket on Gigable and once the goal is met, the date is set and the gig is on!</blockquote>
Crowdfunding has been used to create countless successful shows at traditional venues as well as non-traditional venues including <b>house concerts.</b>

In 2013, the crowdfunding industry grew to be over $5.1 billion worldwide.
