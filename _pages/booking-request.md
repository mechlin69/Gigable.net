<h2>When you request to book an artist, this is what happens:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
<h2>We will contact you and ask a few basic questions.</h2>
</li>
	<li>
<h2>We'll coordinate the details with the artist.</h2>
</li>
	<li>
<h2>We'll setup a page like <a href="http://www.gigable.net/campaigns/alex-dezen-house-concert-houston-tx/">this one</a> for your friends to reserve a ticket!</h2>
</li>
</ul>
