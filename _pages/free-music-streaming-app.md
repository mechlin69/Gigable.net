<h4>We're very excited to announce our official launch was July 1, 2016. We built this platform to allow busy music fans to more easily find amazing music by choosing a hand-curated playlist.</h4>
<h4>There aren't millions of songs to wade through. Choose a playlist and press play. Our staff of musicians and music aficionados scour the planet for the best music in the depths of the long tail.</h4>
<h4>The key feature for the Gigable app is that listeners will get an automatic playlist of the best new music by artists touring near them. If the ticket button is lit, you can securely purchase a ticket to a show, right in the app. It's effortless to find your next favorite song/band and get a ticket to see them live. <strong>Click the app store logo to download the free app for iPhone.</strong> Â (Android version coming very soon!)</h4>
