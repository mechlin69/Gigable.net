<h4>Dating back to the 70's, house concerts have been a great way to experience singer-songwriters performing their best stuff.</h4>
<h4>House concerts have been growing in popularity in recent years. Many artists are taking to living rooms, kitchens, basements, back yards, storefronts and other private venues to play for a small, engaged crowd.</h4>
<h4>Gigable has a <a href="https://www.gigable.net/launch-gig-campaign/artist-roster/">roster of artists</a> who regularly play house concerts (aka living room concerts) and you can easily host one.</h4>
